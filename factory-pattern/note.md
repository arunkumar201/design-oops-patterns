# Factory Pattern

The **Factory Pattern** revolves around the creation of objects using a generic interface.

> "Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate."

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for object creation within a subclass. It allows the sub class to determine or alter the type of object to be instantiated.

## Use Cases

- When handling groups of objects that share similar characteristics.

## Conclusion

The Factory Pattern stands out as a powerful tool for managing object creation with flexibility and encapsulation. It proves particularly valuable in scenarios involving complex object creation or when maintaining a consistent creation process throughout your application is crucial.

# points

## Definition:

> "The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created."

## Purpose:

It encapsulates object creation logic, providing a common interface for creating objects while allowing flexibility in the instantiation process.
Components:

## Product Interface/Class:

Defines the interface for the objects to be created.

## Concrete Products:

Classes implementing the Product interface, representing the different types of objects to be created.

## Factory Interface/Class:

Declares the method(s) for creating objects (Product).
Concrete Factory: Implements the Factory interface, providing the specific implementation for creating objects.

# Advantages:

## Encapsulation:

Objects are created through a common interface, encapsulating the creation logic.
Flexibility: Easy to introduce new types of objects without changing existing client code.
Centralized Configuration: Centralized creation logic for easy maintenance and modification.

## Use Cases:

### When object creation is complex or involves multiple steps.

### When we want to provide a simple way to create different types of objects without exposing their implementation details.

### When we want to ensure a consistent creation process across the application.
