Singleton pattern ensure that a class has only one instance ,while Providing a global access 
to this instance 

- Singletons are the classes which can be instantiated only Once 
- and can access Globally or this instance can be shared through out Application
  
  ***Which Makes the singletons great for managing the global State in the application***

### Singleton solve two problems at same time 
   1. Ensure that a class has only one instance	(single Responsibility Principal)
   2. Provide a global access point to that instance 
   
# Conclusion

The Singleton pattern is valuable when we need to ensure a unique instance of a class, maintain a central point of control, and manage shared resources or global states.
